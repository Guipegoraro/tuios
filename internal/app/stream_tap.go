// StreamTap sees each pane's stream as this client applies it: the snapshot a
// pane is primed from, then every byte and in-band resize that follows it, in
// the order the client applies them. It lets a process that runs this model
// without drawing it (tuios gui-bridge) hand the same stream to a renderer of
// its own, which keeps its own emulator per pane.
//
// Snapshot runs on the Update goroutine before the pane is subscribed, so it
// is ordered before the pane's first Output. A nil state means the pane is
// subscribed without a snapshot, and the renderer must start from a blank
// screen. Output and Resized run on the daemon client's read goroutine. None
// of them may block.
